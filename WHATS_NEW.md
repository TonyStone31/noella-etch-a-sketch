# What's New in Heckers Sketch

<!--
  This is what people see after an update, and under Help > What's new.
  Plain words about what changed for the person drawing; nothing about the
  insides.  Write under "Next release" while working; build.sh renames that
  heading to the tag when it cuts a release.  Sections are shown newest
  first, and an update shows only the ones newer than the version it
  replaced.  Headings: "## v2026.09.05.25" or "## Next release", then
  "### New" and "### Fixed", then "- " bullets.  Keep the bullets short.

## Next release

### New

- Updating shows a proper progress window: download size and percentage,
  the checksum check, the install, and the restart.
- After an update, this window shows what changed.  It is also under the
  help button as "What's new", any time.
- A typed distance on the tape measure lays the guide.  Click the first
  point, aim along an edge or an axis, type how far, and Enter puts down
  the guide line and its point exactly as a click would.
- The program opens in PRO now, not the toy, and a new sheet starts on the
  3D corner view instead of the flat plan.

### Fixed

- On Linux, the program restarts properly after an update.  It used to
  install the new version and then fail to come back up.

## v2026.09.05.25

### New

- Rotate: click the center, a point to measure from, then swing to the
  angle and click, or type it - 45, 22.5, or 8:12 for a slope.  The arrows
  pick the plane by axis color, Ctrl leaves a turned copy, and the angle
  snaps to the fifteens near them.  Q, or the ROTATE button.
- A protractor that lays guides at an angle, the same three clicks.

### Fixed

- Openings in a face now travel with it when it is moved.
- A move locked to blue drew its travel line grey instead of blue.

## v2026.09.05.24

### New

- Notes can be made bigger or smaller: pick one, then + or -.
- Clicking the words of a note picks it.  It used to grab the note for a
  drag and then let go without selecting it.

## v2026.09.05.23

### New

- DXF export: the flat pattern for a cutting table, and the whole drawing
  either flat or as a 3D model, with layers for cuts, bends and notches.

## v2026.09.05.22

### New

- The shop pattern marks brake notches at the ends of every bend line.
- A dimension can be placed outside a closed shape, not only inside it.
- Arcs drawn on a solid's face split that face, the way lines do.

### Fixed

- Offset put its copy a long way from the face.  It stays on the face's
  plane now.

## v2026.09.05.21

### New

- The flat pattern carries the openings cut through a piece.

### Fixed

- The eraser's blue wash stopped at what was in front of the face being
  erased, instead of painting over it.
